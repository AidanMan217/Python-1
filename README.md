These are small personal projects I'm working while I study pure mathematics to learn the basics of Python.

Projects:

1. Double Integration Calculator
   - I started this in November 2022 as a Lua project in ROBLOX because It's the only language I knew at the time. I started with the basic definition of Riemann sums and expanded it to double integration.
     I can expand it further, but it eventually gets too slow especially if you allow more rectangles (partitions). I then rewrote it in Python which was very similar.
